    "options": "a ) 14.3 % , b ) 13.67 % , c ) 33 % , d ) 28.6 % , e ) 49.67 %",
    "Rationale": "\"the exam gives us a number that is easily divisible by 7 to pique our curiosity and tempt us into calculating actual numbers ( also because otherwise the ratio would be incorrect ) . since the question is about percentages , the actual numbers will be meaningless , as only the ratio of that number versus others will be meaningful . nonetheless , for those who are curious , each 1 / 7 portion represents ( 14210 / 7 ) 2,030 employees . this in turn means that 4,060 employees are journeymen and the remaining 10,150 are full time workers . if half the journeymen were laid off , that would mean 1 / 7 of the total current workforce would be removed . this statistic is what leads many students to think that since half the journeymen are left , the remaining journeymen would represent half of what they used to be , which means 1 / 7 of the total workforce . if 1 / 7 of the workforce is journeymen , and 1 / 7 is roughly 14.3 % , then answer choice a should be the right answer . in this case , though , it is merely the tempting trap answer choice . what changed between the initial statement and the final tally ? well , you let go of 1 / 7 of the workforce , so the total number of workers went down . the remaining workers are still 1 / 7 of the initial workers , but the group has changed . the new workforce is smaller than the original group , specifically 6 / 7 of it because 1 / 7 was eliminated . the remaining workers now account for 1 / 7 out of 6 / 7 of the force , which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6 . this number as a percentage is answer choice b , 13.67 % . using the absolute numbers we calculated before , there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total . if 2,030 of them are laid off , then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left , but now out of a total of ( 14,210 - 2,030 ) 12,180 employees . 2,030 / 12,180 is exactly 1 / 6 , or 16.67 % . the answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers , but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation . the underlying principle of percentages ( and , on a related note , ratios ) can be summed up in the brainteaser i like to ask my students : if you \u2019 re running a race and you overtake the 2 nd place runner just before the end , what position do you end up in ? the correct answer is 2 nd place . percentages , like ratios and other concepts of relative math , depend entirely on the context . whether 100 % more of something is better than 50 % more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted . when it comes to percentages on the gmat , the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you . b\"",

    "Problem": "a lady grows cabbage in her garden that is in the shape of a square . each cabbage takes 1 square foot of area in her garden . this year , she has increased her output by 127 cabbages when compared to last year . the shape of the area used for growing the cabbage has remained a square in both these years . how many cabbages did she produce this year ?",
    "options": "a ) 4096 , b ) 4098 , c ) 5000 , d ) 5096 , e ) can not be determined",
    "Rationale": "\"explanatory answer the shape of the area used for growing cabbage has remained a square in both the years . let the side of the square area used for growing cabbage this year be x ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation this year = x 2 sq . ft . let the side of the square area used for growing cabbage last year be y ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation last year = y 2 sq . ft . as the number of cabbage grown has increased by 127 , the area would have increased by 127 sq ft because each cabbage takes 1 sq ft space . hence , x 2 - y 2 = 127 ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 127 . 127 is a prime number and hence it will have only two factors . i . e . , 127 and 1 . therefore , 127 can be expressed as product of 2 numbers in only way = 127 * 1 i . e . , ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 127 * 1 so , ( x + y ) should be 127 and ( x - y ) should be 1 . solving the two equations we get x = 64 and y = 63 . therefore , number of cabbage produced this year = x 2 = 642 = 4096 . alternative approach : use answer choices the area in both the years are squares of two numbers . that rules out choice b , c and d . as 4098,5000 and 5096 are not the square of any number . check choice a : if this year ' s produce is 4096 , last year ' s produce would have been 4096 - 127 = 3969 3969 is the square of 63 . so , 4096 is the answer . choice a\"",

    "Rationale": "i approached this one by plugging in numbers . . . started with c . if 40 are made in 8 hours , then 20 are made in 4 hours . so time of t is 4 , and time of b is 2 . rate together : 20 / 4 + 20 / 2 = 5 + 10 = 15 . so in 1 hour , together make 15 widgets . in 3 hours = 45 . way too much . we can eliminate right away c , b , and a - because b and t reduces the time - the total # of widgets made will be even higher . now between d and e - > try only one . . if it does n ' t work , then the other one is the answer . i picked e : 12 h to make 40 widgets , and 6 hours to make 20 . this is the time of t . time of b = 4 hours . 20 / 6 + 20 / 4 = 10 / 3 + 20 / 4 find lcm of 3 and 4 = 12 . multiply first by 4 , and second by 3 : 40 + 60 / 12 = 100 / 12 divide by 4 : 25 / 3 so this is the rate given . e is the correct answer",

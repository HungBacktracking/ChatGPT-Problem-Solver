    "Rationale": "really hard . but let ' s start with few concepts : 1 . square of an odd integer will be odd . 2 . difference of odd and odd will be even . 3 . any odd integer can be expressed as difference of two squares . 4 . an even integer can be expressed as difference of two squares only if that even integer is a multiple of 4 . assume two odd integers to be ( 2 x - 1 ) and ( 2 x + 1 ) . difference of their squares = ( 2 x + 1 ) ^ 2 - ( 2 x - 1 ) ^ 2 = 4 x ^ 2 + 1 + 4 x - ( 4 x ^ 2 + 1 - 4 x ) = 4 x ^ 2 + 1 + 4 x - 4 x ^ 2 - 1 + 4 x = 8 x now root of 8 x needs to be an integer such that it is equal to the sum of the digits of the two odd integers . 8 = 2 ^ 3 , so x needs to be such that itcompletesa perfect square . if we find x , we can find the value of 2 x + 1 ( larger integer ) and then sum of its digits . let ' s check the options , starting with c . for sum to be 8 , few possibilities are : 17 , 35 , 53 , 71 if we take 17 , the pair is 15 and 17 , meaning x = 8 . 8 x = 64 root of 64 = 4 but 4 is not equal to 1 + 5 + 1 + 7 . reject . if we take 35 , the pair is 33 and 35 , meaning x = 17 . 8 x = 8 * 17 reject since perfect square is not possible . if we take 53 , the pair is 51 and 53 , meaning x = 26 . 8 x = 8 * 26 reject since perfect square is not possible . if we take 71 , the pair is 69 and 71 , meaning x = 35 . 8 x = 8 * 35 reject since perfect square is not possible . i tried each option and the possibilities and then got lost . then , it occurred to me that i was only checking 2 - digit integers . what about 3 - digits ? starting with option a , only 2 - digit odd integer whose sum is 2 is 101 . if we take 101 , the pair is 99 and 101 , meaning x = 50 . 8 x = 8 * 50 = 400 root of 400 = 20 which is indeed equal to 9 + 9 + 1 + 1 . answer ( a ) .",

    "Rationale": "\"the question asks aboutthe largest positive integer that must divide n , not could divide n . since the least value of n for which n ^ 2 is a multiple of 72 is 12 then the largest positive integer that must divide n is 12 . complete solution of this question is given above . please ask if anything remains unclear . i spent a few hours on this one alone and i ' m still not clear . i chose 12 at first , but then changed to 48 . i ' m not a native speaker , so here is how i interpreted this question : the largest positive integer that must divide n = the largest positive factor of n . since n is a variable ( i . e . n is moving ) , so is its largest factor . please correct if i ' m wrong here . i know that if n = 12 , n ^ 2 = 144 = 2 * 72 ( satisfy the condition ) . when n = 12 , the largest factor of n is n itself , which is 12 . check : 12 is the largest positive number that must divide 12 - - > true however if n = 48 , n ^ 2 = 48 * 48 = 32 * 72 ( satisfy the condition too ) . when n = 48 , the largest factor of n is n itself , which is 48 . check : 48 is the largest positive number that must divide 48 - - > true so , i also notice that the keyword ismust , notcould . the question is , why is 48 notmust divide 48 , but instead onlycould divide 48 ? i ' m not clear right here . why is 12 must divide 12 ? what ' s the difference between them ? only restriction we have on positive integer n is that n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 . the least value of n for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 is 12 , thus nmustbe divisible by 12 ( n is in any case divisible by 12 ) . for all other values of n , for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 , n will still be divisible by 12 . this means that n is always divisible by 12 if n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 . now , ask yourself : if n = 12 , is n divisible by 48 ? no . so , n is not always divisible by 48 . b\"",

    "Rationale": "\"the answer will be 19 . explanation : 78 = 2 * 3 * 13 now multiples of 78 , 156 . . . . 780 , now 1000 - 780 = 220 only two more muktiples of 78 can exists . so total number of 3 digit multiples of 78 are 9 + 2 = 11 91 = 13 * 7 - - total number of three digit multiples - - 9 no remember we have a common multiples as well n - - 13 * 7 * 6 = 91 * 6 = 546 so total number of multiples - - 11 + 9 - 1 = 19 . hence answer is 19 . b\"",

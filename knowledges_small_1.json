    "Rationale": "\"the phrasing of the question is difficult for some students . ` ` what percent of 60 is 25 ? ' ' is the same question as ` ` 25 is what percent of 60 ? ' ' many students find this later way of phrasing the question easier to work with . if x is y percent of z , then x / z = y / 100 ; for example , 10 is 50 % of 20 ; x = 10 , y = 50 , and z = 20 similarly , if you wanted to know what percent of 100 is 50 , you would intuitively know that it is 50 % since it is 50 / 100 or 50 per cent ( literally , per 100 ) . applying this logic to the problem at hand : 25 / 60 = . 42 = 42 % thus , 25 is 42 % of 60 if this way of solving the problem is difficult to conceptualize , consider another approach . it should be clear that 30 is 50 % ( or 1 / 2 ) or 60 . since 25 is less than 30 , 25 must be less than 50 % of 60 . this means that any answer that is not less than 50 % is wrong . since 25 % is 1 / 4 and 1 / 4 of 60 is 15 ( since 15 * 4 = 60 ) , 25 % is too small . by process of elimination , the answer is 42 % answer c\"",

    "options": "a ) 5 , b ) 7 , c ) 6 , d ) 31 , e ) 18",
    "Rationale": "explanatory answer step 1 : key data 1 . total value of all certificates sold = $ 93 . 2 . certificates sold were in denominations of $ 3 and $ 5 . 3 . both ' m ' and ' n ' are natural numbers . step 2 : approach the value of all certificates sold , 93 is divisible by 3 . so , a maximum of 31 $ 3 certificates and no $ 5 certificates could have been sold . however , the question states that both ' m ' and ' n ' are natural numbers . hence , at least 1 $ 5 certificate should have been sold . let us reduce the number of $ 3 certificates from theoretical maximum count of 31 by say ' x ' and correspondingly increase $ 5 certificates by ' y ' . evidently , 3 x = 5 y because the value of $ 3 certificates reduced should be the same as the value of $ 5 certificates increased . it means that x has to be a multiple of 5 and y has to be a multiple of 3 . or $ 3 certificates reduce in steps of 5 certificates . step 3 : list down possibilities the following combinations are possible 1 . m = 26 , n = 3 2 . m = 21 , n = 6 3 . m = 16 , n = 9 4 . m = 11 , n = 12 5 . m = 6 , n = 15 6 . m = 1 , n = 18 an alternative way to think of the same concept - replacing five $ 3 certificates with three $ 5 certificates leads to no change in the overall value of certficates sold and gives us a new combination each time . we need to see how many such combinations are possible . answer c",

    "Rationale": "the string of light bulbs will fail if at least one light bulb fails . so , let ' s find the probability of the opposite event and subtract that value from 1 . the opposite event is when none of the 50 light bulbs fails , since the probability of each light bulb not to fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 the the probability that none of the 50 light bulbs fails is 0.95 ^ 50 . hence , the probability that at least one light bulb fails is 1 - 0.95 ^ 50 . answer : d . now , you should have spotted that your reasoning was not right because of one simple thing , consider the case when we have 100 light bulbs instead of 50 , then according to your logic the probability that the string of light bulbs will fail would be 100 * 0.05 = 5 , which is not possible since the probability of an event can not be more than 1 ( 100 % ) .",

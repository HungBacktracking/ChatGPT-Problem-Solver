    "Rationale": "let \u2019 s call the two perfect squares x ^ 2 and y ^ 2 , respectively . then the given information translates as x ^ 2 + 148 = y ^ 2 . subtracting x ^ 2 gives 148 = y ^ 2 \u2212 x ^ 2 , a difference of squares . this , in turn , factors as ( y + x ) ( y \u2212 x ) = 148 . the next step is tricky . it begins with factoring 148 , which breaks down as 2 \u2217 2 \u2217 37 . since we \u2019 re dealing with perfect squares , x and y are positive integers , and ( y + x ) and ( y \u2212 x ) must be paired integer factors of 148 . the options are 148 \u2217 1,74 \u2217 2 , and 37 \u2217 4 . but our number properties establish that ( y + x ) and ( y \u2212 x ) must be either both odd or both even , so only 74 \u2217 2 is an actual possibility . and because for any positive integers ( y + x ) > ( y \u2212 x ) , we can conclude that y + x = 74 and y \u2013 x = 2 . solving by elimination , 2 y = 76 , y = 38 , and x = 36 . finally , we just need to square 36 . but rather than multiplying it out , note that 36 ^ 2 ends in 6 \u2013 as does only one answer , choice a . this answer must be the one we want .",
